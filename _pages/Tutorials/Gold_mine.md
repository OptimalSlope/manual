## OptimalSlope Simulation Setup Tutorial

Follow these steps to configure properties for a cross-section in OptimalSlope to run a simulation:

### 1. Define Bench Properties
Specify properties for benches if your cross-section includes them:
- **Unit Weight**: Weight of material per cubic meter.
- **Bench Face Angle**: Inclination angle of bench faces.
- **Min Berm Width**: Minimum width of berms between benches.
- **Number of Benches**: Total benches count.
- **Bench Height**: Height of each bench.

### 2. Set Rock Properties
Choose between Hoek-Brown and Mohr-Coulomb models and set properties like:
- Strength characteristics.
- Friction parameters.

### 3. General Section Properties
Set general properties for the section:
- **Horizontal Crest Position**: Position of the crest relative to section origin.
- **Slope Height**: Total height of the slope.
- **Target FoS (Factor of Safety)**.
- **Surcharge**: Additional loads like magnitude and inclination.

Ensure all values are accurate and reflect the physical/mechanical characteristics of your material and cross-section specifics.

For detailed guidance, refer to the [OptimalSlope Manual on Bench Properties](https://optimalslope.github.io/manual/pages/properties/6-properties/#bench-properties).
