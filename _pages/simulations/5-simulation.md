**Description**

OptimalSlope runs simulations on the cloud to avoid maxing out local resources and affecting the performance of user's machine due to the nature of computationally heavy simulations.

After the problem of simulation is formulated with required inputs, the simulation window is used to run simulations and obtain the results.

**Configuring user profile**
* To run simulations on the cloud, the user profile is configured under **Tools > Settings > Account**.

**Running simulations**

1. Switch to **Simulation** tab at the botton of the interface.
2. Under **Cross-sections**, select the desirable cross-section.
3. Specify simulation folder.
4. **To start a simulation**, click **Start** button and then enter the configured username.
5. The **Fetch results** button is used to download the results and/or see the progress when simulations are running.

**Results**
* OptimalSlope returns results in a form a plot, which displays estimated optimal profile of a slope.
* The estimated angles and profile coordinates and angles are displayed in the logs.
* The results folder also contains plots and obtained optimal profile data.
**Note**
* When running the same simulation more than once, e.g., with different parameters, select **Yes** to overwrite the existing input data.
