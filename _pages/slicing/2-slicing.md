**Description**

The Slicing tool creates cross-sections through selected shape(s) using cutting planes (XY, XZ or YZ). Cross-sections can be made in parallel to the cutting planes with respect to a global  plane position coordinate (m).

 Vertical planes (XZ, YZ) provides an ability to make vertical cross-sections at different angles by specifiying the azimuth angle (Â°).

> ##### TIP
>
> * Cross-sections automatically inherit properties from their 3D parent stratigraphy. If not entered, properties can be later entered manually either at 3D model or individual slice level.
> * It is advised to define bench properties and strength model before producing cross-sections.

**Usage**

1. Select a shape or multiple shapes.
2. Press the slicing button on the toolbar or right-click on a shape and select cross-section.
3. Define the cutting plane (XY, XZ or YZ).
4. Specify the position of the cutting plane.
5. If required, provide the azimuth (**when working with vertical planes**).
6. Click `Slice` button.
